# C Project 01: Compare Two Numbers

This is a simple C program that takes two integers as input and compares them.

The program:

- Prompts the user to enter two integers (`x` and `y`).
- Validates the input to ensure they are integers.
- Compares the two numbers and prints:
  - `"X is greater than Y"` if x > y
  - `"X is smaller than Y"` if x < y
  - `"X is equal to Y"` if x == y

# Project 02 - Simple Calculator in C

This is a **basic calculator program** written in C that can perform simple arithmetic operations:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

The program takes **two operands** and an **operator** from the user and outputs the result. It also handles **division by zero** gracefully.
